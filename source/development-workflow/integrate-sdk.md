## Application Structure

The diagram below demonstrates what would typically be included in an application that uses the Onboard SDK.

In addition to the OSDK Core Library, and any application specific third party libraries, the application will also need to include a platform specific threading library. OSDK uses threading to handle reading from the 

As threading is platform specific, the OSDK core requires the application pass it a reference to a threading library.

The application needs to pass the OSDK Core a reference to this threading library, so the OSDK can then use it.

## Including DJI OSDK Headers in Your Code

The [hierarchy diagram](../introduction/sdk-architectural-overview.html#hierarchy) in the SDK Architectural Overview shows that the Vehicle class contains references to all components available through the OSDK.
Thus, `Vehicle` acts as an entry point for user code.

Let's take an example - `mission_sample` provided as part of the Linux samples. Here is a snippet of `mission_sample.hpp`:

- **L17-19**:   Includes that your application needs for the code you are writing
- **L22**:      DJI OSDK Include. This is the only DJI OSDK header you need to include in your application.
- **L25**:      Helper functions that read User Configuration files on the Linux platform, and execute activation of the drone.
                You may re-use these functions in your code if you are developing standalone applications for a Linux platform.

## Setting Up Dependencies

This section assumes you are using the CMake build system on Linux; the steps however are general enough to be
conceptually reused with different platforms/build systems.

![integrate-sdk-cmakelists](../images/workflow/integrate_sdk_cmakelists.png)

- **L5**:       Making sure you enable C++11 support, and linking against other third-party libraries
- **L8-17**:    Telling the build system where to find `osdk-core` include files. If you install `osdk-core` to system,
                your includes will be in `/usr/local/include`, so in this example you would set `ONBOARDSDK_SOURCE` to be that directory.
- **L20-27**:   Telling your build system about your own code, and what executable to generate
- **L28**:      Linking your executable against `djiosdk-core`.

Before you run your application, see the [Running your Application](run-application.html) page.
