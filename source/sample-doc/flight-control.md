## Introduction 

The flight control sample demonstrates sending control commands to the aircraft using the Position control command. The sample allows you to run two operations: 

* Take off and Land aircraft
* Take off, flight motion using Position Control and Land aircraft. 

## Goals 

The sample demonstrates a closed loop controller with position commands sent to the aircraft using the positionAndYawCtrl API. It subscribes to the following topics: 
 
1. TOPIC_STATUS_FLIGHT at 10Hz
2. TOPIC_STATUS_DISPLAYMODE at 10Hz
3. TOPIC_QUATERNION at 50Hz
4. TOPIC_GPS_FUSED at 50 Hz

The flight control sample is available on Linux, ROS and STM32.
