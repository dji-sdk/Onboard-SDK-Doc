## Introduction

The Multi Function IO feature of the A3 and N3 Flight Controller supports reading and writing PWM signals, Analog to Digital Conversion and General Purpose Input Output. These new feature are being introduced
  in order to avoid having to arrange additional circuitry or microcontrollers for the mentioned low level functionalities. 
 
### PWM

Pulse Width Modulation allows the control of power supplied to electrical devices such as motors or LEDs. Pulse Width Modulation allows us to vary how much time the signal is high in an analog fashion. 
 
 The A3 and N3 Flight Controller supports writing and reading PWM signals. PWM signals can be written to a user defined pin to control the brightness of an LED, the speed of a motor etc. PWM signals can also be read from an 
  external sensor or microcontroller.
