## Platform-independent Software Environment Setup

#### Download the SDK and Required Tools

- <a href="https://github.com/dji-sdk/Onboard-SDK" target="_blank">Download</a> the onboard SDK repository from Github
- <a href="https://www.dji.com/product/matrice600/info#downloads" target="_blank">Download</a> the DJI PC Assistant 2 software for Windows/Mac
- <a href="http://www.dji.com/product/goapp" target="_blank">Download</a> the DJI GO App to your mobile device

#### Update Firmware

- Connect your computer to the Micro-USB port on the M100/600 or A3/N3. For the M210 (support coming soon!), use the USB-A to USB-A cable provided with the aircraft.
- Update your aircraft/flight controller with the latest released firmware. Please visit the [Compatibility Matrix](../appendix/versioning.html) to find out which SDK version your firmware supports.

#### Enable Flight Controller API control

- With your aircraft/flight controller connected to your PC/Mac, launch DJI Assistant 2 and check the box marked `Enable API Control` on the `SDK` page.

#### Onboard SDK Application Registration

- You must register as a developer with DJI and create an OSDK application ID and Key pair. Please go to <a href="https://developer.dji.com/register/" target="_blank">https://developer.dji.com/register/</a> to complete registration.

#### Flight Platform Activation

Each new vehicle or flight controller must be activated with the DJI server on first SDK use to enable communication with your application.

- We provide APIs for activation.
- All samples implement activation, so if you are trying out a sample app it will automatically activate.

## Ubuntu Linux OES: Software Setup

##### Toolchain

To build standalone Linux applications based on the OSDK, you need:

* A supported C++ compiler - currently only GCC (Tested with gcc 4.8.1/5.3.1)
* A bash shell
* CMake >= 2.8
* A modern Linux distribution

## STM32 OES: Software Setup

##### Toolchain Requirements
- Keil MDK > 5.22 (armcc 5.06)
- Windows PC to run Keil

##### Toolchain Setup

- Configure the USART3 port to a baudrate of 230400 in your sample app
- To download (flash) the App binary to the STM32 board, connect the PC to the STM32's "mini-USB" port.
- In order for Keil to build code for the target board, you need to use Keil's `Pack Installer` to install the latest STM32F4xx_DFP.2.x.x pack, as shown below.
- Alternatively, you can download manually from <a href="http://www.keil.com/dd2/Pack/" target="_blank">http://www.keil.com/dd2/Pack/</a> and import the downloaded file from Pack Installer.)

## Linux OES with ROS: Software Setup

##### Tested Environment:


Onboard SDK ROS should also work on Ubuntu 14.04/ROS Indigo, though it is not officially tested on that combination.

##### Software Requirements:

* Install C, C++ Compiler and Development Tools by installing ``build-essential``
* Install CMake 2.8.3 or newer
* <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment">Install ROS and its dependencies</a>
* Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04 (x86/ARM)
* ROS version: ROS Kinetic

##### Compilation:

1. Assuming you have ROS environment installed and configured, cd into your catkin workspace and run ``catkin_make``. Make sure the source code is in the `src` directory of your catkin workspace.
<br>OR</br>
2. Refer to our .travis.yml build script to install and configure ROS from scratch and then follow with running ``catkin_make`` from catkin workspace.
