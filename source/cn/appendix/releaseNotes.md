## Highlights

- **Support for M210 and M210 RTK:** 
OSDK features are now supported for M210. Currently, hardware synchronization and Multi-function IO are not supported.
- **Stereo vision data from M210 and M210 RTK:** Raw images and disparity map from stereo camera pairs of M210 are now available.
- **M600 backward compatibility:** Supports M600 firmware 1.0.1.20.
- **ROS RTK support:** RTK data via ROS topics.
- **Protocol layer refactor:** Improved performance and better abstraction.
- **Platform Manager:** Better abstraction layer for different computing platforms.
- **Dynamic logging control:** Developers can now start or stop logging.
- **Encryption flag:** Implemented getter/setter to modify encryption flag.

## Supported Firmware

Please download the latest [DJI Assistant 2](https://www.dji.com/matrice-200-series/info#downloads) for M210/M210 RTK support.

- **Waypoint & Hotpoint read API calls:** Ability to read missions' settings and Waypoint index settings from an aircraft.

### Supported Firmware

- A3/A3 Pro: 1.7.1.5
- N3: 1.7.1.5
- M100: 1.3.1.0
- M600/M600 Pro: 1.0.1.60

### Bug Fixes:

- **Control authority UNKNOWN_ACK_ERROR_CODE:** fixed incorrect messaging when trying to obtain or release control.
- **Gimbal mount status check:** SDK will now check whether gimbal is mounted during initialization of vehicle object.
- **STM32 memory footprint:** Reduced OSDK memory footprint by 60%.
- **Receive container firmware version:** Fixed incorrect version which was set in receive container.

### Known Issues

- **Potential SerialDevice infinite loop:** If aircraft is connected incorrectly and thereâ€™s no data on the serial line, the read thread might loop indefinitely.
- **GCC7 compilation:** OSDK will not compile correctly using GCC7.
- **QT Sample M100 Compatibility:** Some M100-specific feature are not supported in QT Sample.
