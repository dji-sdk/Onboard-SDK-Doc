> New Major Release! Onboard SDK 3.3 is a full redesign of the DJI OSDK. Please read the docs for the best developer experience!

The DJI Onboard SDK (OSDK) allows you to build powerful, automated drone applications for supported DJI vehicles (<a href="http://www.dji.com/product/matrice100" target="_blank">Matrice 100</a>, <a href="http://www.dji.com/product/matrice600" target="_blank">Matrice 600</a> or <a href="http://www.dji.com/matrice-200-series" target="_blank">Matrice 210/210-RTK</a>) or flight controllers (<a href="http://www.dji.com/product/a3" target="_blank">A3</a> or <a href="http://www.dji.com/product/n3" target="_blank">N3</a>).

This document helps you get started with the various aspects of building OSDK applications.

Note. OSDK 3.3 does not support Matrice 100, please refer to [here](../M100-Docs/main.html) for previous documentation.

## Get Started Immediately

Developers can get started immediately by following the steps to [run a sample application](../quick-start/quick-start.html). If you haven't been here before, please read the rest of this document.
