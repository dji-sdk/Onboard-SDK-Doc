## Intro
This section talks about an implementation of the Data Transparent Transmission using an iOS app and a parser on the Onboard side. As mentioned in the [Data Transparent Transmission](../introduction/data-transparent-transmission.html) section, 'Data Transparent Transmission' is developed to combine the benefits of Mobile and Onboard SDK APIs by establishing a connection between a Mobile Device and an OES. Via the 'Data Transparent Transmission', developers are able to send data from their Mobile Device to OES to control over the program while receiving computing results, log data, flight status and external sensor data etc.

The iOS app along with the parser allows the user to run the pre-existing functions supported on the respective platforms.
