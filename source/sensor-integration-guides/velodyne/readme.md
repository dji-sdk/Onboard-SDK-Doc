title: Integration with Velodyne LiDAR
version: v3.1.8

## Introduction

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems are approaching the size, weight, and cost to enable payload integrations into small UAS. LiDAR is a compelling sensor for collision avoidance and commercial UAV applications, such as mobile mapping, surveying, and inspection. In this release, an example has been developed to support logging real-time LiDAR data into a standard pcap file.  The pcap log files can be post processed with Velodyne's VeloView or other third party LiDAR data processing and visualization software. 


Figure 1 shows a point cloud map inside a building generated by this example integration of LiDAR on an M100.  We use a Velodyne VLP-16 Puck Lite and a powerful Intel i5 based OES in this tutorial to show the integration of DJI onboard SDK with LiDAR data collection.

## Hardware Setup

The Matrice 100 drone is used for the demonstration. A DC-DC power supply is employed to obtain the power from the battery and convert/regulate DC voltage for both i5 based Linux mini computer and LiDAR, as shown in Figure 2 below.

  Properties: non-isolated step-down power supply module   
  Input voltage: 8-35V   
  Output voltage: 1.5-24V adjustable     
  Output current: 5A MAX, recommended: below 5V,4A long-term; 6-9V, 3A; 10V-15V,2.5A

####Linux mini computer

  "Zini-1660" is the 6th Generation Intel Core i5 Processor based Linux mini computer with the following specifications:

  Linux Version:  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS  
  Processor: i5-6260U 1.8 GHz 2 core, 4 threads (Intel Iris Graphics 540)     
  Memory: 16 GB DDR4-2133     
  Storage: 250GB Crucial M.2 SSD
  Networking  Gigabit Ethernet (included)    
  WiFi  IntelÂ® Wireless AC Dual-Band (2.4/5ghz) (included)

####LiDAR

  Velodyne's VLP-16 PUCK LITE is the latest lighter weight/smaller version of the VLP-16 PUCK for the applications with lower weight and small size requirements.  More information can be found [here](http://velodynelidar.com/vlp-16-lite.html).

## Software Guide
The demo software is located in:

`.\onboardsdk\thirdparty` with two the following subfolders:
`.\onboardsdk\thirdparty\velodyne_vlp16puck_lite_API_example\lidar_APIs_LIB`
`.\onboardsdk\thirdparty\velodyne_vlp16puck_lite_API_example\QtConsoleExample`

The library (`.\onboardsdk\thirdparty\velodyne_vlp16puck_lite_API_example\lidar_APIs_LIB`) provide a UDP driver (based on Boost) and data logging with pcap files. This library can be integrated into OES.  Please note that: Boost needs to be version 1.50 or later; pcap needs to be version 1.40 or later.

The example (`.\onboardsdk\thirdparty\velodyne_vlp16puck_lite_API_example\QtConsoleExample`) provide a Qt console application to use the lib to gather and log data into a pcap file. Please note that Qt needs to be the latest version Qt5.7.

The data is logged into: 
	
`/home/(user)/Vlp16_logfiles/`

The data file is automatically named with the format starting with `vlp16_log_` plus Hour_Min_Seconds_Month_Date_Year, for example:

`Vlp16_log_17_32_08_07_27_2016.pcap`

Velodyne's VeloView can be downloaded from <http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VeloView>.  Figure 5 below is the point cloud map of a pcap log file in VeloView.
