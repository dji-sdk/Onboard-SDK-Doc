This SDK is for developers with:

- programming experience in C++
- embedded systems knowledge
- a [compatible](../introduction/osdk-hardware-introduction.html#Supported-Products) DJI vehicle/flight controller
- your own Onboard Embedded System (OES) with an available TTL UART port.
    - For x86 platforms, we recommend small-form-factor PCs that can be powered from the aircraft's bus
    - The [DJI Manifold](https://store.dji.com/product/manifold) is an excellent OES meant to harness the full potential of DJI OSDK
    - Among embedded systems, we recommend the STM32F4 (and the Discovery board).
- Windows PC/Mac to run the required software tools
- an iOS or Android mobile device to run DJI Go
    - Make sure you have an internet connection on your mobile device the first time you run your application
- (optional) an iOS device to run the [Mobile-Onboard SDK Sample](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-OSDK-iOS-App) application, and a MacOS laptop with XCode 7 to compile and load this application
